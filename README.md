# Sign Language Recognition (SLR)

## Overview
This project implements a **Sign Language Recognition (SLR)** system using machine learning. The goal is to recognize hand gestures from images or videos and translate them into corresponding text or speech.

## Features
- Uses **Machine Learning / Deep Learning** models for recognition.
- Processes images and videos to detect hand gestures.
- Supports **American Sign Language (ASL)** dataset.
- Can be expanded for real-time inference.

## Dataset
The project utilizes an ASL dataset from Kaggle, containing images of different hand gestures representing letters and words.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (Optional, for interactive development)
- Required Python Libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras opencv-python
  ```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/suryansh2004/Sign_Language_Interpreter
   cd sign-language-recognition
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook SLR.ipynb
   ```
3. Train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Model Training
- The dataset is preprocessed (resizing images, normalization, augmentation).
- A deep learning model (e.g., CNN or Transformer-based) is trained on the dataset.
- Performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Results
- Model achieves **high accuracy** on test data.
- Can recognize various ASL signs effectively.

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time sign language detection using OpenCV.
- Expand dataset to include more variations of signs.
- Optimize model for **better accuracy and faster inference**.
